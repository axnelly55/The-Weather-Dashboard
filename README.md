# The-Weather-Dashboard
This project allows users to determine the best destinations to sight see on a trip by seeing the weather outlook in multiple cities ahead of time.

When a user is searching for their destination, 
    they are then presented with current and future conditions for the city of choice. This is then added to search history log.

As a user tries to view weather conditions for that specific city,
    they are then presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index as this assignment requires.

As the user goes ahead to view the UV index,
    they are then presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe!

Users go ahead and view future weather conditions for that city,
     and are then presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity

As users proceed to click on a city in the search history column,
    they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city.

When users open the weather dashboard,  
    they are presented with the last searched city forecast.

    This application allows for the most appropriate preparatory actions to be taken by those looking to sight see and experience different places! 
    
    
    Happy traveling and social distancing!
